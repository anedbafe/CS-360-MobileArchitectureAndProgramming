# CS-360-Mobile ArchitectureAnd Programming

## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
Inventory App is an application designed to manage warehouse inventories. It helps users gain better control over their daily tasks and improves productivity. The app allows for efficient product management, 
ensures quick access to information, and simplifies the inventory handling process.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To meet user needs, I designed a simple yet functional interface that provides key tools for inventory management. One example is the product modification screen, which allows users to intuitively add, edit, 
and delete products. This user-centered approach facilitated inventory management and ensured a smooth experience. The design was successful because it prioritized simplicity without sacrificing functionality, 
ensuring that any user could easily navigate the application, regardless of their experience level.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I adopted a scalable approach to the application's development. I designed and programmed each feature separately, ensuring that each module fulfilled its purpose before integrating the next one. 
Code reusability was key in this process, allowing me to optimize development and avoid redundancies. These strategies can be applied in future projects as they promote a more organized, maintainable, and efficient code structure.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The project development process was challenging but rewarding. One of the biggest obstacles was integrating SQLite with Java in the Android environment. To overcome this challenge, 
I started with the user interface design, which allowed me to better understand the application's structure before addressing the database implementation. This strategy helped me organize the workflow and ensure each component was implemented correctly before moving on to the next development phase.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
One of the most significant achievements was implementing the SQLite database, which allowed inventory information to be stored and managed from the user interface. 
It was a very satisfying experience to see the application come to life by enabling real-time data manipulation. This aspect of the project demonstrated my ability to integrate databases with mobile applications and reinforced my 
knowledge of Android app development.
